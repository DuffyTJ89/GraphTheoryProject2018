# GraphTheoryProject2018

I am a third year Software development student at GMIT and this repo is for my Graph Theory project.

# Aims

  - The main aim of this project was to make a Go program that can build a non-deterministic finite automaton from a regular expression and then check to see if that regular expression matches a user inputted string.
  
# Run the application

Clone the repo and open git bash (or similar) in the folder and then type :

`go run main.go`

The program will run and you will be asked to enter the Regular expression you want to use. Then you will be asked to input a string to check against that regular expression. The result will be printed out to your screen.
